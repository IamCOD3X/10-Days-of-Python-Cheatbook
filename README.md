# History and development of Python

Section 1: The Origins of Python
Python, an interpreted, high-level programming language, was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. Guido, a Dutch programmer, began developing Python in December 1989 as a hobby project during his Christmas break at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in the Netherlands. He aimed to design a language that combined the best features of existing programming languages while also being easy to read and understand.

Section 2: Python 1.x and 2.x
The initial release of Python, version 0.9.0, was published in February 1991. It was followed by the release of Python 1.0 in January 1994, which introduced several important features, including lambda functions, map/filter/reduce functions, and a built-in system for exceptions.

Python 2.0, released in October 2000, brought significant improvements and added new features such as list comprehensions, a garbage collector, and support for Unicode. Python 2.x became widely adopted and was used for many years, with the final version of the 2.x series being Python 2.7, released in July 2010.

Section 3: Python 3.x and the Transition
Despite the success of Python 2.x, Guido van Rossum recognized the need for a more modern and cleaner language design. In December 2008, Python 3.0 (initially known as Python 3000) was released. Python 3.0 introduced several backward-incompatible changes to improve consistency and remove redundant or obsolete features.

However, the transition from Python 2.x to Python 3.x proved to be challenging due to the significant differences between the two versions. Many existing libraries and projects were written for Python 2.x and required modifications to work with Python 3.x. This led to a period of coexistence where both Python 2.x and Python 3.x were used concurrently.

Section 4: Python's Popularity and Community
Python's popularity grew steadily over the years due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Its ease of use and extensive standard library made it a preferred language for both beginners and experienced developers. Python's adoption was also fueled by its strong community, which actively contributed to the language's development, created numerous libraries, and provided support through forums, conferences, and online resources.

Python's ecosystem expanded rapidly, with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Django becoming popular tools for scientific computing, data analysis, visualization, and web development, respectively.

Section 5: Python 3.5 and Beyond
Python 3.5, released in September 2015, introduced several new features, including the async and await keywords for asynchronous programming, type hints using the typing module, and the matrix multiplication operator (@). Python

Type python --version and press Enter. <br>
The command should display the installed Python version. This verifies that Python is successfully installed. <br>

Step 4: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended) <br>
Virtual environments provide isolated environments for Python projects, allowing you to manage dependencies and package versions easily. <br>
Open a command prompt or terminal. <br>
Install the virtualenv package by running the following command: <br>

```
pip install virtualenv
```
Create a new virtual environment in your desired directory:

```
virtualenv myenv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate

```
On macOS/Linux:
bash

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```
Step 5: Install Additional Packages (Optional)
You can use pip, the Python package installer, to install additional packages or libraries for your projects. For example:

```
pip install numpy
```
Step 6: Set Up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Optional)

While not required, an IDE can enhance your development experience. Some popular Python IDEs include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Atom. <br>
Download and install the IDE of your choice from their respective websites. <br>
Configure the IDE to use the Python interpreter from the virtual environment you set up (if applicable). <br>
That's it! You have now installed Python and set up a basic development environment. You can start writing Python code in your preferred text editor or IDE, and execute it using the Python interpreter. <br>

# Writing your first Python Program


Sure! Here's an example of a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

python

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
To write your first Python program, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

Step 2: Create a new file and save it with a .py extension, such as first_program.py. This extension indicates that the file contains Python code.

Step 3: In the file, type or copy the following code:

python

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
This line of code uses the print() function to output the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

Step 4: Save the file.

Step 5: Open a command prompt or terminal.

Step 6: Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file using the cd command (e.g., cd Documents/Python).

Step 7: Run the Python program by typing the following command and pressing Enter:


python first_program.py
The Python interpreter will execute your code, and you should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

Congratulations! You've written and executed your first Python program. From here, you can explore and learn more about Python by building more complex programs and experimenting with its features and libraries.

# Python Syntax and Structure 

Here are some key aspects of Python's syntax and structure:

Comments: Comments are lines of code that are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to add explanatory notes or disable specific lines temporarily. In Python, you can add comments using the hash symbol (#).
```python
# This is a comment in Python
```
Statements and Indentation: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code instead of brackets or keywords. Consistent indentation is crucial for maintaining the structure of your code. The standard convention is to use four spaces for each level of indentation.
```
if condition:
    # Indented block of code
    statement1
    statement2
else:
    # Another indented block of code
    statement3
    statement4
```    
Variables and Data Types: Variables are used to store data in Python. Unlike some other programming languages, you don't need to explicitly declare the variable type in Python. It dynamically assigns the data type based on the value assigned.
```python
name = "John"  # String
age = 25  # Integer
height = 1.75  # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```
Control Flow: Python provides several control flow statements to control the execution of code. Common control flow statements include if-else, for loops, and while loops.

# If-else statement
```
if condition:
    # Code block executed if condition is true
    statement1
    statement2
else:
    # Code block executed if condition is false
    statement3
    statement4
```
# For loop
```
for item in iterable:
    statement
```
# While loop
while condition:
    statement
Functions: Functions in Python allow you to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. They can accept parameters and return values.
```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("John")  # Output: Hello, John!
```
Modules: Python offers a rich ecosystem of modules and packages that provide additional functionality. You can import these modules into your code to use their features.

```python
import math

radius = 5
area = math.pi * radius**2
```
Error Handling: Python allows you to handle errors using try-except blocks. You can catch specific types of exceptions and define appropriate actions.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    statement1
    statement2
except ExceptionType:
    # Code executed if the specified exception occurs
    statement3
```   
These are just some fundamental aspects of Python's syntax and structure. Python has many more features and concepts that can be explored as you dive deeper into the language.

# Variables and Data types

## Variables

In Python, variables are used to store values that can be referenced and manipulated later in your code. Variables are created when you assign a value to them using the assignment operator (=).

Here's the basic syntax for creating variables in Python:

```python
variable_name = value
```
Here's an example:
```python
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = True
```
In this example, we created three variables: ```name```, ```age```, and ```is_student```. The name variable is assigned the value "John", the age variable is assigned the value 25 (an integer), and the is_student variable is assigned the value True (a boolean). <br>

Python is a dynamically typed language, so you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it. You can also reassign a variable to a different value or a different data type later in your code. <br>

Variables can be used in expressions and can be manipulated using various operations. For example:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
sum = x + y
```
In this example, we perform addition using the variables x and y and assign the result to the sum variable.

Variables in Python are case-sensitive, so name and Name are considered different variables. It's good practice to use descriptive names for your variables to make your code more readable and maintainable.

You can print the value of a variable using the print() function:

```python
print(name)
print(age)
print(is_student)
```
This will output the values of the variables ```name```, ```age```, and ```is_student```.

Remember to choose meaningful names for your variables to improve the readability and understandability of your code.

## Data Types

In Python, there are several built-in data types that you can use to represent different kinds of information. Here are the most common data types in Python:

Numeric Types:
```python

# Integer
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10

# Floating-Point Number
y = 3.14
print(y)  # Output: 3.14

# Complex Number
z = 2 + 3j
print(z)  # Output: (2+3j)
```
String:
```python
name = "John"
print(name)  # Output: John
```
Boolean:
```python
is_student = True
print(is_student)  # Output: True
```
List:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
Tuple:
```python
point = (2, 3)
print(point)  # Output: (2, 3)
```
Dictionary:
```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
```
Set:
```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}
print(fruits)  # Output: {'banana', 'apple', 'orange'}
```
None:
``` python
value = None
print(value)  # Output: None
```
These examples demonstrate how to assign values to variables of different data types and print their values. Remember that you can perform various operations and use specific methods associated with each data type to manipulate and work with the data stored in these variables.

# Basic operations and expressions

Python supports various basic operations and expressions. Here are some common ones along with code examples:

### Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+) <br>
Subtraction (-) <br>
Multiplication (*) <br>
Division (/) <br>
Modulo/Remainder (%) <br>
Exponentiation (**) <br>

```python

a = 10
b = 5

addition = a + b           # 10 + 5 = 15
subtraction = a - b        # 10 - 5 = 5
multiplication = a * b     # 10 * 5 = 50
division = a / b           # 10 / 5 = 2.0 (float division)
remainder = a % b          # 10 % 5 = 0
exponentiation = a ** b    # 10 ** 5 = 100000
```
### Comparison Operations:

Equal to (==) <br>
Not equal to (!=) <br>
Greater than (>) <br>
Less than (<) <br>
Greater than or equal to (>=) <br>
Less than or equal to (<=) <br>

```python
x = 5
y = 10

equal_to = x == y           # False
not_equal_to = x != y       # True
greater_than = x > y        # False
less_than = x < y           # True
greater_than_equal = x >= y # False
less_than_equal = x <= y    # True
```
### Logical Operations:

Logical AND (and) <br>
Logical OR (or) <br>
Logical NOT (not) <br>

```python
p = True
q = False

logical_and = p and q       # False
logical_or = p or q         # True
logical_not = not p         # False
```
### Assignment Operations:

Simple assignment (=) <br>
Addition assignment (+=) <br> 
Subtraction assignment (-=) <br>
Multiplication assignment (*=) <br>
Division assignment (/=) <br>
Modulo assignment (%=) <br>

```python
x = 10

x += 5      # x = x + 5    => 15
x -= 3      # x = x - 3    => 12
x *= 2      # x = x * 2    => 24
x /= 4      # x = x / 4    => 6.0
x %= 4      # x = x % 4    => 2.0
```
These are just a few examples of basic operations and expressions in Python. Python provides many more operators and built-in functions that can be used for more complex computations.

# Input and Output Handling 

Input and output handling in Python can be done using various functions and methods. Here are some common ways to handle input and output in Python with code examples:

### Standard Input and Output (Console):

input() function: Reads input from the user as a string. <br>
print() function: Displays output to the console. <br>

```python
# Input from the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Output to the console
print("Your name is", name)
print("Your age is", age)
```
### File Input and Output:

open() function: Opens a file in a specified mode (e.g., 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending). <br>
read() method: Reads the contents of a file. <br>
write() method: Writes data to a file. <br>
close() method: Closes the file. <br>

```python
# Writing to a file
file = open("output.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, World!\n")
file.write("This is a sample file.")
file.close()

# Reading from a file
file = open("output.txt", "r")
contents = file.read()
print(contents)
file.close()
```
### Formatted Output:
Using the % operator: Allows you to format strings with placeholders. <br>
Using the format() method: Provides a more flexible way to format strings. <br>
Using f-strings (formatted string literals): Introduced in Python 3.6, provides a concise and readable way to format strings. <br>

```python
name = "John"
age = 25

# Using % operator
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))

# Using format() method
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))

# Using f-strings
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```
### Command-Line Arguments:
sys.argv: A list in the sys module that contains command-line arguments passed to the script.

```python
import sys

# Command-line arguments: python script.py arg1 arg2
arg1 = sys.argv[1]
arg2 = sys.argv[2]

print("Argument 1:", arg1)
print("Argument 2:", arg2)
```
These are some common techniques for handling input and output in Python. Python provides additional libraries and modules for more advanced input/output operations, such as csv for CSV file handling and json for JSON data serialization.

# Control flow statements
Here are examples of control flow statements using if, else, and loops in Python:

### 1. if statement:
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

### 2. if-else statement:
```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")
else:
    print("It's not too hot.")
```

### 3. if-elif-else statement:
```python
num = 0

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

### 4. for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Count:", i)
```

### 5. while loop:
```python
counter = 0

while counter < 5:
    print("Count:", counter)
    counter += 1
```

### 6. nested loops:
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, "*", j, "=", i*j)
```
Output:
```
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6
3 * 1 = 3
3 * 2 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
```

#### Note: Remember to indent the code blocks properly in Python, as indentation is significant in determining the block of code associated with a control flow statement.

# Lists, tuples, and sets

### 1. Lists:
Lists are ordered collections of items that can be modified (mutable). They are represented by square brackets ([]).

```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Accessing elements
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Modifying an element
fruits[1] = 'grape'
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'grape', 'orange']

# Adding elements
fruits.append('kiwi')
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'grape', 'orange', 'kiwi']
```

### 2. Tuples:
Tuples are ordered collections of items that cannot be modified (immutable). They are represented by parentheses () or without any delimiters.

```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (3, 4)

# Accessing elements
print(coordinates[0])  # Output: 3

# Tuples are immutable, so modifying will result in an error
coordinates[1] = 5  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

### 3. Sets:
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They do not allow duplicate values and are represented by curly braces ({}).

```python
# Creating a set
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}

# Adding elements
fruits.add('kiwi')
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi'}

# Sets automatically remove duplicates
fruits.add('apple')
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi'}

# Set operations
vegetables = {'carrot', 'broccoli', 'banana'}
common_fruits = fruits.intersection(vegetables)
print(common_fruits)  # Output: {'banana'}
```

Note that sets are not ordered, so the order of elements in a set may vary when printed.

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of lists, tuples, and sets in Python. Remember that lists and sets are mutable, while tuples are immutable.

# Dictionaries and hash maps

In Python, dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs, providing a way to map values to unique keys. Here's an example of dictionaries (which can be considered as hash maps):

```python
# Creating a dictionary
student = {
    'name': 'John',
    'age': 20,
    'grade': 'A'
}

# Accessing values
print(student['name'])  # Output: John

# Modifying values
student['age'] = 21
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 21, 'grade': 'A'}

# Adding new key-value pairs
student['city'] = 'New York'
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 21, 'grade': 'A', 'city': 'New York'}

# Removing a key-value pair
del student['grade']
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 21, 'city': 'New York'}

# Checking if a key exists
if 'age' in student:
    print("Age exists in the dictionary.")

# Iterating over keys and values
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, ':', value)
# Output:
# name : John
# age : 21
# city : New York
```

Dictionaries allow you to store and retrieve values based on unique keys. They are commonly used for tasks such as storing and manipulating data with custom identifiers or performing lookups based on specific keys.

# Strings and string manipulation

In Python, strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). String manipulation refers to various operations performed on strings, such as concatenation, slicing, formatting, and more. Here's an example demonstrating some common string operations:

```python
# String concatenation
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World!"
concatenated_string = string1 + " " + string2
print(concatenated_string)  # Output: Hello World!

# String length
length = len(concatenated_string)
print(length)  # Output: 12

# Accessing characters by index
first_char = concatenated_string[0]
last_char = concatenated_string[-1]
print(first_char, last_char)  # Output: H !

# Slicing a string
substring = concatenated_string[6:11]
print(substring)  # Output: World

# Reversing a string
reversed_string = concatenated_string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)  # Output: !dlroW olleH

# Converting to uppercase and lowercase
uppercase_string = concatenated_string.upper()
lowercase_string = concatenated_string.lower()
print(uppercase_string, lowercase_string)  # Output: HELLO WORLD! hello world!

# Splitting a string into a list
split_list = concatenated_string.split(" ")
print(split_list)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World!']

# String formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 25
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old."
print(formatted_string)  # Output: My name is Alice and I'm 25 years old.
```

The language provides a rich set of string methods and functions that allow for various operations and transformations on strings.

# Arrays and matrices

In Python, arrays and matrices can be implemented using different libraries, such as NumPy or built-in data structures like lists. <br>
Let me show you examples of both.

Example using NumPy library:
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(my_array)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]

# Creating a matrix
my_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(my_matrix)
# Output:
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]
#  [7 8 9]]

# Accessing elements in an array or matrix
print(my_array[2])  # Output: 3
print(my_matrix[1][0])  # Output: 4

# Slicing arrays or matrices
print(my_array[1:4])  # Output: [2 3 4]
print(my_matrix[0:2, 1:3])
# Output:
# [[2 3]
#  [5 6]]

# Performing operations on arrays or matrices
array_sum = np.sum(my_array)
print(array_sum)  # Output: 15

matrix_sum = np.sum(my_matrix)
print(matrix_sum)  # Output: 45
```

Example using built-in lists for arrays and nested lists for matrices:
```python
# Creating an array
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_array)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a matrix
my_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(my_matrix)
# Output:
# [[1, 2, 3],
#  [4, 5, 6],
#  [7, 8, 9]]

# Accessing elements in an array or matrix
print(my_array[2])  # Output: 3
print(my_matrix[1][0])  # Output: 4

# Slicing arrays or matrices
print(my_array[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(my_matrix[0:2][1:3])
# Output:
# [[4, 5, 6],
#  [7, 8, 9]]

# Performing operations on arrays or matrices
array_sum = sum(my_array)
print(array_sum)  # Output: 15

matrix_sum = sum(sum(my_matrix, []))
print(matrix_sum)  # Output: 45
```

Both examples demonstrate creating arrays and matrices, accessing elements, slicing, and performing operations using either the NumPy library or built-in Python data structures.

# Stacks, queues, and linked lists

Here are examples of implementing stacks, queues, and linked lists in Python.

1. Stack:
A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0

    def push(self, item):
        self.stack.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return "Stack is empty"
        return self.stack.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return "Stack is empty"
        return self.stack[-1]


# Example usage:
my_stack = Stack()
my_stack.push(1)
my_stack.push(2)
my_stack.push(3)

print(my_stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(my_stack.peek())  # Output: 2
print(my_stack.is_empty())  # Output: False
```

2. Queue:
A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element inserted is the first one to be removed.

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return "Queue is empty"
        return self.queue.pop(0)

    def peek(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return "Queue is empty"
        return self.queue[0]


# Example usage:
my_queue = Queue()
my_queue.enqueue(1)
my_queue.enqueue(2)
my_queue.enqueue(3)

print(my_queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1
print(my_queue.peek())  # Output: 2
print(my_queue.is_empty())  # Output: False
```

3. Linked List:
A linked list is a data structure where each element (node) contains a reference to the next node.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.head is None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.is_empty():
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def prepend(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.is_empty():
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            new_node.next = self.head
            self.head = new_node

    def delete(self, data):
        if self.is_empty():
            return "Linked list is empty"

        if self.head.data == data:
            self.head = self.head.next
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                if current.next.data == data:
                    current.next = current.next.next
                    return
                current = current.next

    def display(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            print("Linked list is empty")
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current:
                print(current.data, end=" ")
                current = current.next
            print()


# Example usage:
my_list = LinkedList()
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append(2)
my_list.prepend(3)
my_list.delete(2)
my_list.display()  # Output: 3 1
print(my_list.is_empty())  # Output:
```
# Defining and using functions

Defining functions in python is very simple.
Here are some examples of defining and using functions in Python:

1. Function without parameters:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Calling the function
say_hello()
```

Output:
```
Hello!
```

2. Function with parameters:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    return sum

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
8
```

3. Function with default parameter values:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

# Calling the function with one argument
greet("Alice")

# Calling the function with two arguments
greet("Bob", "Hi")
```

Output:
```
Hello, Alice!
Hi, Bob!
```

4. Function with variable number of arguments (variadic function):

```python
def calculate_average(*args):
    total = sum(args)
    average = total / len(args)
    return average

# Calling the function with different number of arguments
result1 = calculate_average(2, 4, 6)
result2 = calculate_average(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

print(result1)
print(result2)
```

Output:
```
4.0
5.0
```

5. Recursive function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Calling the function
result = factorial(5)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
120
```

These examples demonstrate various aspects of defining and using functions in Python. You can customize the functions based on your requirements and reuse them in different parts of your code.

# Function parameters and return values

In Python, functions can have parameters to accept input values, and they can also return values as the result of their computations. Here's an example that illustrates function parameters and return values:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    return sum

# Calling the function and storing the result
result = calculate_sum(3, 4)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
7
```

In this example, the function `calculate_sum` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the numbers to be added. It computes the sum of the two numbers and returns the result using the `return` statement.

When calling the function `calculate_sum(3, 4)`, the values `3` and `4` are passed as arguments to the function. The function performs the addition operation and returns the sum, which is then stored in the `result` variable. Finally, the value of `result` is printed, resulting in `7`.

You can have functions with multiple parameters of different types, and you can customize the logic inside the function to perform various operations and computations. The return value allows you to capture and utilize the result of the function in your code.

# Lambda functions and closures
In Python, lambda functions are anonymous functions that can be defined inline and used where a function object is expected. Closures, on the other hand, are functions that remember the values in the enclosing scope even if they are executed outside that scope. They are created when a nested function references a value from its containing function.

Code Example

```python
def outer_function(x):
    y = 4

    # Define a lambda function within the outer function
    square = lambda a: a ** 2

    # Define a closure that references the variables from the outer function
    def inner_function(b):
        return x + y + square(b)

    return inner_function

# Create a closure by calling the outer function
closure = outer_function(3)

# Call the closure, passing an argument
result = closure(2)

print(result)  # Output: 15
```

In the above example, we have an `outer_function` that takes a parameter `x`. Inside the `outer_function`, we define a lambda function called `square` that squares its argument. We also define an `inner_function` that references the variables `x`, `y`, and `square` from the outer function. This creates a closure because `inner_function` remembers the values of `x`, `y`, and `square` even after `outer_function` has finished executing.

We then call `outer_function` with an argument of `3`, which returns the `inner_function` as a closure. We assign this closure to the variable `closure`. Finally, we call `closure` with an argument of `2`, and it performs the computation `x + y + square(b)` using the remembered values, resulting in `15` being printed.

Lambda functions and closures are powerful features in Python that allow for more concise and flexible code, especially in situations where you need to define small, one-time functions or when you want to encapsulate data within a function.

# Modules and importing

Modules are files containing Python definitions and statements that can be imported and used in other Python programs. They allow you to organize your code into reusable components and promote modularity. Importing modules in Python allows you to access the functions, classes, and variables defined in those modules.

Here's an example that demonstrates importing a module and using its functions:

Suppose we have a module called `math_operations.py`, which defines two functions: `addition` and `subtraction`. The module looks like this:

```python
# math_operations.py

def addition(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtraction(a, b):
    return a - b
```

Now, let's create another Python script called `main.py` where we import and use the functions from the `math_operations` module:

```python
# main.py

import math_operations

result_addition = math_operations.addition(5, 3)
result_subtraction = math_operations.subtraction(10, 4)

print(result_addition)     # Output: 8
print(result_subtraction)  # Output: 6
```

In the `main.py` script, we use the `import` statement to import the `math_operations` module. This makes all the functions defined in the `math_operations` module accessible in our script.

We then call the `addition` and `subtraction` functions from the `math_operations` module, passing the required arguments. The results are stored in the variables `result_addition` and `result_subtraction`, respectively.

Finally, we print the results, which will output `8` and `6`, respectively.

There are also different ways to import specific functions or variables from a module. Here's an example using the `from` keyword:

```python
# main.py

from math_operations import addition, subtraction

result_addition = addition(5, 3)
result_subtraction = subtraction(10, 4)

print(result_addition)     # Output: 8
print(result_subtraction)  # Output: 6
```

In this case, we use the `from` keyword to import only the `addition` and `subtraction` functions from the `math_operations` module directly into our script's namespace. This allows us to use the functions without specifying the module name.

These examples demonstrate the basic concepts of modules and importing in Python. They enable you to separate your code into reusable modules and easily access the functionalities defined in those modules.

# Creating and using packages

In Python, a package is a way to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is simply a directory that contains Python module files and an additional `__init__.py` file, which marks the directory as a package.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to create and use packages in Python:

Let's say we have the following directory structure:

```
my_package/
    __init__.py
    math_operations/
        __init__.py
        addition.py
        subtraction.py
```

In this example, we have a package called `my_package` that contains a sub-package called `math_operations`. Inside the `math_operations` sub-package, we have two module files: `addition.py` and `subtraction.py`. The `__init__.py` files in both the package and sub-package are empty files that indicate the directory as a package.

Now, let's see how we can use these packages and modules in our Python code:

```python
# main.py

from my_package.math_operations.addition import add
from my_package.math_operations.subtraction import subtract

result_addition = add(5, 3)
result_subtraction = subtract(10, 4)

print(result_addition)     # Output: 8
print(result_subtraction)  # Output: 6
```

In the `main.py` script, we use the `from` keyword to import the `add` function from the `addition` module within the `math_operations` sub-package of the `my_package` package. Similarly, we import the `subtract` function from the `subtraction` module.

We can now call the `add` and `subtract` functions as if they were defined in our script directly. The results are stored in the variables `result_addition` and `result_subtraction`, respectively.

Finally, we print the results, which will output `8` and `6`, respectively.

By organizing related modules into packages, you can create a hierarchical structure and avoid naming conflicts. It provides a way to group related functionality and promote better code organization and reusability.

Note: In Python 3.3 and above, the `__init__.py` file is not required for a directory to be recognized as a package. However, it is still recommended to include an empty `__init__.py` file to maintain compatibility with older versions of Python and to clearly indicate the package's purpose.

# Introduction to object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. <br>
Each object has its own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods), allowing for modular and reusable code. <br>
Python is an object-oriented programming language that fully supports OOP concepts. Let's explore OOP in Python with a code example.

```python
# Define a class
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.is_running = False

    def start_engine(self):
        self.is_running = True
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model}'s engine is now running.")

    def stop_engine(self):
        self.is_running = False
        print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model}'s engine is now stopped.")

    def honk(self):
        if self.is_running:
            print("Beep beep!")
        else:
            print("The engine is not running. Start the engine first.")

# Create instances of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2021)
car2 = Car("Tesla", "Model S", 2022)

# Accessing attributes
print(car1.brand)  # Output: Toyota
print(car2.model)  # Output: Model S

# Calling methods
car1.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine is now running.
car2.honk()         # Output: The engine is not running. Start the engine first.

car2.start_engine()  # Output: The Tesla Model S's engine is now running.
car2.honk()         # Output: Beep beep!

car1.stop_engine()   # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine is now stopped.
```

In the example above, we define a `Car` class with attributes such as `brand`, `model`, `year`, and `is_running`. The `__init__` method is a special method used to initialize the object's attributes. We also define methods like `start_engine`, `stop_engine`, and `honk`, which perform actions on the car object.

We then create two instances of the `Car` class (`car1` and `car2`) and access their attributes using dot notation (`car1.brand`, `car2.model`). We can also call methods on the instances (`car1.start_engine()`, `car2.honk()`), which operate on the specific instance's data.

Object-oriented programming helps organize code into logical units (objects) and promotes code reuse and modularity. It allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and abstraction of complex systems.

# Classes and Objects

In Python, objects are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Here's an example to illustrate objects and classes in Python:

```python
# Define a class
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Create objects (instances) of the Person class
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
person2 = Person("Bob", 30)

# Access attributes
print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice
print(person2.age)   # Output: 30

# Call methods
person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
person2.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 30 years old.
```

In the example above, we define a `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`. The `__init__` method is a special method that gets called when a new object is created. It initializes the object's attributes using the arguments passed during object creation.

We also define a `greet` method that prints a greeting using the object's attributes. The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class and allows us to access its attributes and methods.

We then create two instances of the `Person` class (`person1` and `person2`) by calling the class as if it were a function and passing the necessary arguments.

We can access the attributes of the objects using dot notation (`person1.name`, `person2.age`) and call their methods (`person1.greet()`, `person2.greet()`).

In this way, each object of the `Person` class can have its own values for the `name` and `age` attributes, and calling the `greet` method will display the appropriate information for each object.

Classes provide a way to define and create objects with shared attributes and behaviors. Objects, on the other hand, are specific instances of a class that have their own unique data.

# Inheritance and polymorphism

In Python, you can create class hierarchies using inheritance and leverage polymorphism to work with objects of different classes through a common interface. 

Here's an example to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism in Python:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement the speak() method.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Cow(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Moo!"

def make_animal_speak(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

# Create instances of different animal subclasses
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")
cow = Cow("Daisy")

# Call the speak() method using polymorphism
make_animal_speak(dog)  # Output: Woof!
make_animal_speak(cat)  # Output: Meow!
make_animal_speak(cow)  # Output: Moo!
```

In the example above, we define a base class `Animal` that has an `__init__` method to set the `name` attribute and a `speak` method. The `speak` method raises a `NotImplementedError` because it's meant to be overridden by subclasses.

We then create three subclasses: `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow`. Each subclass defines its own `speak` method, providing a unique implementation of the behavior.

The `make_animal_speak` function takes an `Animal` object as an argument and calls its `speak` method. Since each subclass of `Animal` overrides the `speak` method, the appropriate method implementation is invoked based on the actual object type passed to the function. This is an example of polymorphism.

Finally, we create instances of the `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow` classes, and pass them to `make_animal_speak` to see the polymorphic behavior in action.

When you run the code, you will get the expected outputs: "Woof!", "Meow!", and "Moo!", corresponding to the `speak` methods of the respective animal subclasses.

# Encapsulation and Data Hiding

Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a class, hiding the internal details and providing a public interface for interacting with the object. In Python, encapsulation can be achieved by using access modifiers and property decorators to control access to class members.

Here's an example to illustrate encapsulation and data hiding in Python:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self._make = make
        self._model = model
        self._year = year
        self._mileage = 0

    def get_make(self):
        return self._make

    def get_model(self):
        return self._model

    def get_year(self):
        return self._year

    def get_mileage(self):
        return self._mileage

    def set_mileage(self, mileage):
        if mileage >= 0:
            self._mileage = mileage
        else:
            raise ValueError("Mileage cannot be negative.")

    def drive(self, miles):
        if miles >= 0:
            self._mileage += miles
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid mileage.")

# Create a car instance
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)

# Accessing data using getter methods
print(my_car.get_make())    # Output: Toyota
print(my_car.get_model())   # Output: Camry
print(my_car.get_year())    # Output: 2020

# Setting and accessing mileage
my_car.set_mileage(5000)
print(my_car.get_mileage())  # Output: 5000

# Driving the car
my_car.drive(100)
print(my_car.get_mileage())  # Output: 5100

# Trying to set negative mileage (raises ValueError)
my_car.set_mileage(-100)    # Raises ValueError
```

In the code example above, we have a `Car` class that represents a car object. The class has instance variables `_make`, `_model`, `_year`, and `_mileage`, all of which are intended to be hidden from direct access.

To achieve encapsulation and data hiding, we use the underscore prefix convention to indicate that these variables are intended to be private. Although they can still be accessed outside the class, it is considered a convention that they should not be accessed directly.

To provide controlled access to these private variables, we define getter methods (e.g., `get_make`, `get_model`, etc.) that return their values. These methods allow external code to retrieve the values indirectly, maintaining encapsulation by preventing direct access to the private variables.

We also define a setter method (`set_mileage`) to set the value of `_mileage`. The setter method performs input validation to ensure that the mileage is not negative.

The `drive` method allows us to increment the `_mileage` by a given number of miles. Again, this method performs input validation to ensure the mileage increment is not negative.

In the example, we create an instance of the `Car` class and demonstrate accessing the private variables using the getter methods (`get_make`, `get_model`, etc.), setting the mileage using the `set_mileage` method, and incrementing the mileage using the `drive` method.

Attempting to set negative mileage using `set_mileage` raises a `ValueError` to enforce data integrity and validation.

By following this approach, we encapsulate the internal details of the `Car` class and provide controlled access to the data through public methods, promoting data hiding and encapsulation principles.

# Advanced OOP concepts

In Python, abstract classes and interfaces are essential concepts in object-oriented programming. Although Python does not have a formal interface keyword like some other languages, we can use abstract base classes (ABCs) from the `abc` module to create abstract classes and implement interfaces.

1. Abstract Classes:

Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own. They serve as a blueprint for other classes, defining common methods that subclasses must implement. To create an abstract class in Python, we use the `ABC` class from the `abc` module and decorate abstract methods with the `@abstractmethod` decorator.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius

# Attempt to instantiate the abstract class will raise TypeError.
# shape = Shape()

rectangle = Rectangle(5, 4)
print("Rectangle Area:", rectangle.area())
print("Rectangle Perimeter:", rectangle.perimeter())

circle = Circle(3)
print("Circle Area:", circle.area())
print("Circle Perimeter:", circle.perimeter())
```

2. Interfaces:

In Python, interfaces are not explicitly defined, but we can create a class with abstract methods to represent an interface. The implementation of these methods must be provided by the classes that implement the interface. Here's an example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class LoggerInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def log(self, message):
        pass

class ConsoleLogger(LoggerInterface):
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"Console Log: {message}")

class FileLogger(LoggerInterface):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

    def log(self, message):
        with open(self.filename, 'a') as file:
            file.write(f"{message}\n")

# Create instances of classes implementing the LoggerInterface
console_logger = ConsoleLogger()
file_logger = FileLogger("log.txt")

console_logger.log("This is a console log.")
file_logger.log("This is a file log.")
```

In this example, `LoggerInterface` is not an explicit keyword, but the `LoggerInterface` class acts as an interface by defining an abstract method `log()`. The classes `ConsoleLogger` and `FileLogger` implement this interface by providing their own implementation for the `log()` method.

# Reading From and Writing to Files

In Python, you can read from and write to files using built-in file handling functions. Here's a simple code example demonstrating how to read from a file and write to a file:

1. Reading from a file:

Suppose you have a file called "input.txt" with the following content:

```
Hello, this is the content of the input file.
Welcome to the file handling in Python.
```

You can read the content of this file using Python as follows:

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('input.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read all lines and store them in a list
    lines = file.readlines()

# Print the content of the file
for line in lines:
    print(line.strip())  # strip() removes the trailing newline character
```

2. Writing to a file:

Let's create a new file called "output.txt" and write some content to it:

```python
# Content to write to the file
content_to_write = [
    "This is the first line.",
    "Here comes the second line.",
    "Finally, the third line!"
]

# Open the file in write mode (this will create the file if it doesn't exist)
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    # Write each line from the content_to_write list to the file
    for line in content_to_write:
        file.write(line + '\n')  # Add a newline character at the end of each line
```

After running this code, you'll have a new file "output.txt" with the following content:

```
This is the first line.
Here comes the second line.
Finally, the third line!
```

Remember to always use the `with` statement when working with files, as it ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised during the operation.


# Working with directories and file paths

Working with directories and file paths in Python is essential for file management and manipulation tasks. Python provides the `os` and `os.path` modules to work with directories and file paths. Additionally, Python 3.4+ introduced the `pathlib` module, which provides a more object-oriented and platform-independent approach for handling paths.

Here are some code examples using both the `os` module and the `pathlib` module:

### Using `os` module:

1. Get the current working directory:

```python
import os

current_directory = os.getcwd()
print("Current directory:", current_directory)
```

2. Create a new directory:

```python
import os

new_directory = "my_new_directory"
os.mkdir(new_directory)
```

3. Check if a directory exists:

```python
import os

directory_to_check = "my_directory"
if os.path.exists(directory_to_check):
    print(f"The directory {directory_to_check} exists.")
else:
    print(f"The directory {directory_to_check} does not exist.")
```

4. List files in a directory:

```python
import os

directory_path = "my_directory"
files_list = os.listdir(directory_path)
print("Files in the directory:", files_list)
```

5. Join paths safely:

```python
import os

directory = "my_directory"
file_name = "example.txt"

# Join the directory and file name safely
file_path = os.path.join(directory, file_name)
print("File path:", file_path)
```

### Using `pathlib` module (Python 3.4+):

1. Get the current working directory:

```python
from pathlib import Path

current_directory = Path.cwd()
print("Current directory:", current_directory)
```

2. Create a new directory:

```python
from pathlib import Path

new_directory = Path("my_new_directory")
new_directory.mkdir()
```

3. Check if a directory exists:

```python
from pathlib import Path

directory_to_check = Path("my_directory")
if directory_to_check.exists():
    print(f"The directory {directory_to_check} exists.")
else:
    print(f"The directory {directory_to_check} does not exist.")
```

4. List files in a directory:

```python
from pathlib import Path

directory_path = Path("my_directory")
files_list = [file.name for file in directory_path.iterdir() if file.is_file()]
print("Files in the directory:", files_list)
```

5. Join paths safely:

```python
from pathlib import Path

directory = Path("my_directory")
file_name = "example.txt"

# Join the directory and file name safely
file_path = directory / file_name
print("File path:", file_path)
```

Both approaches are valid and can be used depending on the specific use case. The `pathlib` module provides a more modern and convenient way of working with file paths and should be preferred when using Python 3.4+.

# File modes and permissions

In Python, you can work with file modes and permissions using the built-in `open()` function, which is used to open files for reading, writing, or appending. File modes and permissions determine how you can interact with the file. Here's an example that demonstrates different file modes and permissions:

```python
# File Modes:
# 'r': Read (default mode)
# 'w': Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file)
# 'a': Append (opens a file for writing at the end, creates a new file if it doesn't exist)
# 'x': Exclusive creation (creates a new file, but raises an error if the file already exists)
# 'b': Binary mode (for binary files)
# 't': Text mode (default mode, for text files)

# File Permissions:
# 'r': Read permission
# 'w': Write permission
# 'x': Execute permission

# Example 1: Read from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Content read from the file:")
    print(content)

# Example 2: Write to a file
with open('new_file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is a new file!")

# Example 3: Append to a file
with open('existing_file.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("\nThis line will be appended.")

# Example 4: Exclusive creation with binary mode
try:
    with open('exclusive_file.txt', 'xb') as file:
        file.write(b"This is an exclusive binary file.")
except FileExistsError:
    print("File already exists.")

# Example 5: Setting file permissions (UNIX-like systems only)
import os

file_path = 'new_file.txt'
# Set read, write, and execute permissions for the owner
os.chmod(file_path, 0o700)

# Check file permissions
permissions = oct(os.stat(file_path).st_mode & 0o777)
print(f"File permissions for {file_path}: {permissions}")
```

Please note that the ability to set file permissions using `os.chmod()` is specific to UNIX-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.). Windows systems have a different way of managing file permissions.

Remember to replace the file names and paths in the examples with actual file paths on your system. Additionally, the ability to set permissions programmatically may require elevated privileges, depending on your operating system and configuration.

# In Python, you can interact with standard input (usually the keyboard) and standard output (usually the terminal/console) using the built-in `input()` and `print()` functions, respectively. Here's an example that demonstrates how to use standard input and output:

```python
# Standard Input (Keyboard)
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Convert input to an integer

print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# Standard Output (Terminal/Console)
print("This is a simple example of standard output.")
print("You can print multiple values using the print function.")
print("You can also format strings using the f-string syntax.")

# Redirecting Standard Output to a File
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    print("This will be written to the file.", file=file)
    print("So will this.", file=file)

print("Standard output has been redirected to 'output.txt'.")

# Reading from a File and Printing to Standard Output
with open('output.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_contents = file.read()
    print("Contents of 'output.txt':")
    print(file_contents)
```

In this example, `input()` is used to read user input from the keyboard, and `print()` is used to display output on the terminal. The program also demonstrates how to redirect standard output to a file using the `file` parameter of the `print()` function.

When you run the above code, it will prompt you for input, display output on the terminal, and then create an "output.txt" file with the redirected output.

Remember to replace file paths and names as needed to match your system's configuration.

# Serialization and deserialization (JSON, XML, CSV) 

Serialization is the process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. Deserialization is the reverse process, where the serialized data is transformed back into its original form. In Python, you can perform serialization and deserialization using various formats, such as JSON, XML, and CSV. Here's how you can do it using code examples:

### JSON Serialization and Deserialization:

```python
import json

# Serialization (Python object to JSON)
data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
json_data = json.dumps(data, indent=4)  # Serialize with indentation
print("Serialized JSON:")
print(json_data)

# Deserialization (JSON to Python object)
json_string = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Los Angeles"}'
parsed_data = json.loads(json_string)
print("\nDeserialized Python object:")
print(parsed_data)
```

### XML Serialization and Deserialization:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Serialization (Python object to XML)
data = {
    "name": "Mary",
    "age": 28,
    "city": "Chicago"
}
root = ET.Element('person')
for key, value in data.items():
    ET.SubElement(root, key).text = str(value)
xml_data = ET.tostring(root, encoding='utf-8').decode('utf-8')
print("Serialized XML:")
print(xml_data)

# Deserialization (XML to Python object)
xml_string = '<person><name>Susan</name><age>22</age><city>Houston</city></person>'
xml_root = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
parsed_data = {elem.tag: elem.text for elem in xml_root}
print("\nDeserialized Python object:")
print(parsed_data)
```

### CSV Serialization and Deserialization:

```python
import csv

# Serialization (Python list of dictionaries to CSV)
data_list = [
    {"name": "Robert", "age": 35, "city": "Seattle"},
    {"name": "Emily", "age": 29, "city": "San Francisco"}
]
csv_file = 'data.csv'
with open(csv_file, mode='w', newline='') as file:
    fieldnames = data_list[0].keys()
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(data_list)
print("Serialized CSV data to 'data.csv'.")

# Deserialization (CSV to Python list of dictionaries)
read_data = []
with open(csv_file, mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        read_data.append(row)
print("\nDeserialized Python list of dictionaries from CSV:")
print(read_data)
```

These examples demonstrate basic serialization and deserialization using JSON, XML, and CSV formats. Remember to customize the data and file paths according to your needs.
